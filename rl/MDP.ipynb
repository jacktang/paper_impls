    "Reinforcement learning environment can be modeled with Markov Decision Process (MDP).\n",
    "MDP provides a mathematical framework for modeling sequential decision making in situations where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision maker (exactly like games which we can only control our moves but have no control on the opponentâ€™s actions).\n",
    "In MDP environment, Agent needs to find an optimal policy to maximize the rewards."
