    "the next few sales you’d make. On the other hand, if you sell the N shares too slow (i.e., too few in the first few hours), you might transact at good prices but then you risk running out of time, which means you will have to dump a lot of shares with time running out which in turn would mean transacting at prices below the best price. Moreover, selling too slow exposes you to more uncertainty in market price movements over a longer time period, and more uncertainty in sales proceeds means the Expected Utility objective gets hurt. Thus, the precise timing and sizes in the breakup of shares is vital. You will need to have an estimate of the Temporary and Permanent Price Impact of your Market Orders, which can help you identify the appropriate number of shares to sell at the start of each hour."
